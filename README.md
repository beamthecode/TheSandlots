# Project Overview

  

## Description

This app is a mock up of an informational app that could be used to learn about the different Major League Baseball ballparks. The app utilizes Map Kit, which allows users to view each ballpark on the map. Each ballpark site is clickable and then includes pertinent information on its own detail screen. 

The app allows the user this functionality:

- Users can cycle through the list of ball parks by using a next button, or they can zoom out of the map and explore on their own.
-  The app allows users to click 'learn more' on the ballpark of interest. A new sheet is presented that includes photos, information about the ballpark, and a link to its wikipedia page.
